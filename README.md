# wichack23
This was the project that we, Avery Carle, Rosaline Flowers, and Claire Kreisel, created for WiChacks 2023.
It was intended to scan a database of new legislation in state congresses and look for keywords that could indicate problematic and harmful legislation, then display it in a useful way on a website.
Each of the parts as listed below are mostly complete, but we ran out of time to integrate together.
- Website with heatmap of detected bills by Rosaline Flowers
- Database by Claire Kreisel
- Webscraper by Avery Carle
